I am Derya Kurt. I am classically trained as a graphic designer and illustrator and 
have recently begun working as a Product Designer, offering UX and visual design expertise
to the world of websites, mobile applications, and other software products and services
that a business may need. I have a passion for aesthetically beautiful things, a desire to
understand how it all works, and never-ending compassion and empathy for people, which is 
absolutely necessary when making products that they use. I am looking for freelance/contract 
or permanent full-time employment with a company that understands the importance of a good 
user experience. Is that you? [Email me](mailto:deryastyle@me.com), let's talk!
