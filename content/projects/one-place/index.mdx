## What is One Place?

One Place is a website and app for an upcoming psychedelic mental health treatment community 
for patients and mental health professionals. 

## What Problem Are We Solving?

Psychedelics as a class of therapy has shown promise in treating mental health in early research,
especially when paired with the guidance and therapy of mental health professionals. However, it's
very hard to find this kind of therapy at the moment because of the current legal situation 
surrounding psychedelics. Many resources online for psychedelics discuss recreational use, not necessarily
therapy as part of a well-defined mental health treatment program. In addition, current scientific research 
and information on state of the art therapies are not well discussed outside of professional mental health 
settings, making it difficult for the average person to find this information and to seek treatment for 
their conditions. I wanted to make this information easier for people to find, and I wanted them to be able 
to speak with researchers and mental health professionals directly. The easiest way to do that, I thought, was 
to build a community where everyone can gather, in addition to tools that will make it easier to get therapy 
and help, whether through a clinical trial, a therapist program, or even a retreat program.

## The Process

I began working on One Place in the fall of 2021 with preliminary user and industry research. 
This allowed me to understand the burgeoning psychedelic mental health industry from a holistic
perspective, and I crafted multiple user personas for patients and mental health and industry professionals
who will be using the community and its resources.

## The Personas

There are two main user types: Patients and Providers. The Providers are further subdivided into Therapists, 
Clinical Trial Coordinators, and Retreat Managers. Providers list out the types of therapy that they provide 
through various forms on the One Place website, and Patients can search for those therapies available using 
the search tools available to them at One Place.

Once the personas were created, I generated some user flow diagrams to outline the processes a user
will be able to perform on the website and mobile app. The two main user types, patients and therapists,
interact with One Place in different ways and both in conjunction with and independently of each other.

After the low fidelity wireframes were validated with users, I set out to work making the high fidelity prototypes in Figma.

Below are screenshots from the clinical trial search flow.
